- What's is a pattern?
A pattern is a reusable solution to a occurring problem, (within a given context in software design).

A example of a pattern that we're all familiar with is the pattern we learn back in elementary school to perform divisions. (note there are many patterns to a problem)

We'll take a look at the following patterns in software design:

1. Creational Patterns
2. Structural Patterns
3. Behavioral Patterns
