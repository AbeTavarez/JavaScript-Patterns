    <h1>Behavioral Patterns</h1>
    <p>
      <span>Behavioral Patterns</span> are focused on improving the
      communication between objects in a system. It's similar to implementing
      better communication in between people.
    </p>

    <h2>Observer Pattern</h2>
    <p>Meteor JS</p>

    <h2>State Pattern</h2>
    <p>React JS</p>

    <h2>Chain of Responsibility Pattern</h2>
    <p>
      Going through a sequence of functionality to complete a task. Example: a
      chain of functionality that the user has to go though to complete a
      purchase on a website.
    </p>

    <h2>Iterator Pattern</h2>
    <p>Lopping over a set of data</p>

    <h2>Strategy Pattern</h2>
    <p>
      Encapsulating code by creating a classes or functions and reusing those
      functions and classes.
    </p>

    <h2>Memento Pattern</h2>
    <p>
      The Memento Pattern is a temporary state of your data retaining the info
      while being converted from one format to another. The data never losses
      its accuracy despite several conversions and formats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is basically providing temporally state of an object and restoration of
      that object from a conversion from a different format. It's normally used
      in Serialization and De-serialization of data like converting an object to
      JSON to send it over the network and then converting it back to an object.
    </p>

    <h2>Mediator Pattern</h2>
    <p>
      The Mediator Pattern provides a set of objects which interact with each
      other mostly by having a centralize authority dictating the terms in
      between objects.
    </p>

    <h2>Command Pattern</h2>
    <p>
      The Command Pattern is one that encapsulates actions or operations as
      objects. Ex. Redux where each function (actions creators, reducers ...) is
      abstracted from each other but are still used through the execution of the
      code inside the app.
